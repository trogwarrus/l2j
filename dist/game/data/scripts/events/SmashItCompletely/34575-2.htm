Calm down? Why? I might look a bit crazy, but I am in fact very calm!<br>
You want to know more about the buff?<br>
Well... I'll try to keep calm. Listen here! Woo-hoo!<br>
1. When you use a <font color="058fd8">Watermelon Seed</font>, a Watermelon will appear. Its size is up to a chance!<br>
2. The Watermelon will break open in 30 sec., but you can attack it and break it faster. When you do, you have a chance to receive a <font color="058fd8">buff</font> and an <font color="058fd8">Ice Box</font>.<br>
3. <font color="058fd8">The bigger the Watermelon</font>, the longer you have to hit it until it breaks and the <font color="058fd8">higher</font> probability of receiving a buff and an Ice Box.<br>
4. Be careful, <font color="LEVEL">you can't receive the buff and the reward if you are standing too far from the Watermelon</font>.<br>
