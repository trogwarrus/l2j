Ordinary blacksmiths aren't able to craft Elysium weapons. Those are very special. Many warriors are longing to obtain them.<br>
However, there's a small problem. The weapons are bound to our homeland, Elysian, and that's why <font color="ff6868">they work only while our guild is here</font>.<br>
When we are gone, the weapons will also disappear. But while we are here, I can guarantee their highest quality.<br>
One weapon cost <font color="LEVEL">10,000,000 adena</font>. Do you want to buy it?<br>
