I've seen Blacksmith of Mammon change the type of R110-grade helmets, gloves and boots. Impressive, but he can't change type of upper and bottom armor.<br>
I can. I'm able to modify upper and bottom R110-grade armor.<br>
But there is one little detail. I modify <font color="LEVEL">at least enhanced Leviathan upper and bottom armor</font>.<br>
Oh, there is one more thing you have to know. <font color="ff6868">If you've changed the appearance of your armor, the effect will be removed</font>, so be careful.<br>
Take all the other equipment except upper and bottom armor to Blacksmith of Mammon. I appreciate business integrity.<br>
So, do you want to give it a shot?<br>
