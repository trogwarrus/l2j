As a bodyguard, I'm always searching for better equipment. Now I'm exploring the weapons, in which the power of dragons is hidden. It's not so easy, as the dragon power is extremely potent and has a lot of effects.<br>
By now, I've managed to find out only how to <font color="LEVEL">seal the weapons with the dragon power in a pack</font>.<br>
You can obtain 1 of the 31 types of Dragon Weapons from the sealed pack. Keep in mind, that <font color="ff6868">there is a chance to get your old weapon too</font>.<br>
Take note that <font color="ff6868">augmented weapons or weapons with special effects</font> can't be sealed in a pack. First you need to remove these effects by a blacksmith.<br>
I can put <font color="LEVEL">Dragon Weapons Lv. 3</font> into a pack. Are you interested?<br>
