Once again. If you want to change your dual class, you have to bring me <font color="LEVEL">300,000,000</font> adena.<br>
I should remind you that you can't choose your active class. Your skills will be reset, and you have to learn new ones all by yourself. Are you sure you want to reawaken your dual class?<br>
