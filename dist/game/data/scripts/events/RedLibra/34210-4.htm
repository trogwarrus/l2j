I think you're ready.<br>
Anyway, don't worry, you can always change your mind.<br>
You can ask <font color="ff6868">Eraton</font> about changing the main class.<br>
An opportunity to change your destiny is a great gift. However, I hope you learn all the details and think twice before you decide to do anything drastic.<br>
Well... Good luck!<br>
