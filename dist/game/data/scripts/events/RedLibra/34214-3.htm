Now I'm not so busy monster hunting as before, so I could learn something about artifacts from Artisan Black.<br>
His knowledge has helped me to find out how to <font color="LEVEL">change artifact class</font>. The point is, every hero should be able to change the artifact type.<br>
Well, my technique is not perfect yet, that's why not every artifact can be used.<br>
Please note that <font color="LEVEL">only the following types of artifacts can be changed</font>: <font color="LEVEL">Attack/ Defense/ Support/ Balance</font>.<br>
But if everything goes well, I plan to resign and devote myself to creating artifacts.<br>
What do you think? Are you interested?<br>
