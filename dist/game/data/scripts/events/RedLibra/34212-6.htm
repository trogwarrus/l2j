Thanks to countless researches and my patience, I've found a way to safely modify the power of circlets.<br>
It's a very complex procedure that requires maximum concentration. That's why not any circlet can be modified. For example, circlets that can't be exchanged are not good for it - too complicated, if you know what I mean.<br>
Radiant Circlet would be the most suitable item.<br>
If you're going to modify the power of <font color="LEVEL">Radiant Circlet</font>, it will cost you <font color="LEVEL">1,500,000,000 adena</font>.<br>
So, what do you think?<br>
