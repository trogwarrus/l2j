I've heard that local blacksmith have mastered the technique of Soul Crystal extraction.<br>
I was very interested, so I started my own research. Finally I learned how to change one crystal soul for another and then to seal them.<br>
At the end, <font color="LEVEL">I put sealed Soul Crystals in a special box</font>. If you want, I can exchange your Soul Crystal for a Box containing a different Soul Crystal. <font color="ff6868">If you wish, you can bring back the old soul</font>. If you are lucky enough, of course.<br>
I can pack <font color="LEVEL">Soul Crystals of Lv. 5-8</font> into the box.<br>
What do you think? Are you interested?<br>
