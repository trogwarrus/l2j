I am Elder Green from the Red Libra Guild. I sell the rarest rarities from all around the world!<br>
There's something I want to tell you. I know the secret of the dual class reawakening. Even Raina and Joachim don't know about it. But I can entrust you with the secret.<br>
Also I have <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Attribute Change Crystals</font> that can change the attribute of your weapon. Think ir over!<br>
One more thing: the Chaos Essence has list its power and can no longer be used to change the main class after the Awakening. I'm sorry, but you will have to use a Stone of Destiny.<br>
