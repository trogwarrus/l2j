The buff will be active for <font color="LEVEL">24 hours</font>.<br>
Its effect is very similar to that of <font color="LEVEL">Freya's Ice Rose</font>, so well-loved by all.<br>
I can apply it to you for <font color="LEVEL">100,000,000 adena</font>. Trust me, it's worth every coin!<br>
The effect <font color="LEVEL">remains upon changing class and after death</font> and doesn't disappear upon entering instance zones. However, in all other circumstances it will be removed. Well, what do you say?<br>
