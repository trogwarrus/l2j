Raina hasn't enough power and experience to keep the same level after the dual class reawakening. It's a very complex task, and not everybody can do it. But my technique is special. I'm able to <font color="LEVEL">keep the same level</font> after the <font color="LEVEL">dual class reawakening</font>. However, you should understand that it's impossible to transfer all knowledge of a dual class. All skills of previous class will be removed. You have to learn the awakening skills of your new class by yourself. Oh, I nearly forgot to mention that the skill enchantment will also be removed!<br>
If you want to reawaken your dual class, bring me <font color="LEVEL">300,000,000 adena</font>.<br>
