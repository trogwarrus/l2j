I can take your Agathion Charm and give you a <font color="LEVEL">box with another one of the same enchant value</font>. But you must meet two conditions.<br>
First of all, your Agathion charm must be powerful enough. It must be <font color="LEVEL">either a Greater one enchanted to +5 or a common one enchanted to +10</font>.<br>
Secondly, <font color="LEVEL">there should be only one Agathion Charm in your inventory</font>. Otherwise there's a chance that powers of different Agathions will conflict with each other.<br>
And thirdly, I don't work for free. To exchange +5 Greater Agathion Charm, you will have to pay 1 billion adena. And for the exchange of +10 Agathion Charm I will take 100 million adena.<br>
What do you think? Are you interested?<br>
