I'm Wealthy Merchant Red. I'm the Red Libra Guild Leader.<br>
The Red Libra Guild has a rich and storied history. We travel a lot. So we have come to the continent to see our friends.<br>
We also want to have some fun, and we have prepared special items.<br>
Have you heard about the <font color="ff6868">Stone of Destiny</font>? Listen to me if you want to change your fate.<br>
As a gift for the game update we are giving one Stone of Destiny to everyone for free.<br>
Also you can purchase <font color="LEVEL">Red's Elysium Blessing buff</font> from me.<br>
