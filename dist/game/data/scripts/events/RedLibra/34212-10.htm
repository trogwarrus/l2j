Now you can change the type of the Eternal armor!<br>
However, you can do it only to <font color="LEVEL">R99-grade armor with set effects</font>.<br>
Oh, there is one more thing you have to know. <font color="ff6868">If you've changed the appearance of your armor, the effect will be removed</font>, so be careful.<br>
If you have no set effect, get it from a town blacksmith.<br>
So, do you want to give it a shot?<br>
