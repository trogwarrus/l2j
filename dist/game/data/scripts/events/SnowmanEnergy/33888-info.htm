<html><body>Santa Claus:<br>
I had prepared tons of gifts and useful things to celebrate Christmas, but wretched <font color="LEVEL">Snowmen</font> stole everything! I can't leave it like that. They need to be taught a lesson.<br>
Settle the problem, and you will get the stolen gifts. By the way, some Snowmen give nice buffs when defeated.<br>
So, let me tell you where <font color="LEVEL">you can encounter Snowmen</font>.<br>
You can hunt them in the following locations: Ivory Tower Crater, Silent Valley, Alligator Island, Tanor Canyon, Neutral Zone, Forest of Mirrors, Field of Silence, Isle of Prayer, Field of Whispers, Ketra Orc Outpost, Varka Silenos Barracks, Breka's Stronghold, Sel Mahum Training Grounds, Plains of the Lizardmen, Fields of Massacre, Wall of Argos, Sea of Spores, Wasteland, Cemeetery, Dragon Valley, and Fafurion Temple.<br>
