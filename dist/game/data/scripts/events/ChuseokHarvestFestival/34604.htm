Greetings, hero! I'm Moon Child, Full Moon Keeper.<br>
Have you heard that a <font color="LEVEL">wish-fulfilling stone</font> appeared in Aden?<br>
Bring me this stone if you can find it. I'll examine it and figure out if it really can make wishes come true. And if you collect various item shards, you can try to use them in the <font color="ff6868">limited craft on the weekend</font>. It is available every week on Saturday and Sunday from 20:00 until 23:00!<br>
By the way, I've heard that a large Full Moon will rise in Aden during the Moon Festival Week!<br>
If you make a wish upon the Full Moon you can get lots of gifts from the Moon Festival, make sure to come in the specified time!<br>
