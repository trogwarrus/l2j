The instance zone is inaccessible at the time.<br>
Only your party leader can ask me for the first-time visit to the instance zone. There is no other way to enter.<br>
Keep in mind that the party cannot move to an instance zone if there is a character in the party, which does not meet level requirements. Also teleportation will be impossible if any of the party members stand too far from me.<br>
Also you cannot enter an instance zone if other party is already in. Please, check the requirements once more.
