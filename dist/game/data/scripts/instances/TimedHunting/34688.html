<html><body>Alligator Island Patrol Teleporter:<br>
The army of Fafurion has recently seized the Alligator Island, but we will win it back! With such great warriors as you on our side, it just can't be otherwise.<br>
If you meet Fafurion's soldiers here on the island, be careful. They are armed much better than our enemies in the fields.<br>
Where do you want to go?<br>
