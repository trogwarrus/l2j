The sudden attack of the Fafurion army has had my head spinning. The first group of Fafurion's soldiers can be found in the Field of Silence to the north trying to subjugate the Krofin. The second one, composed of elite warriors, is setting up camp in the Field of Whispers to the south.<br>
According to our scouts' information, Fafurion's Praetorians - the most skilled and the best equipped warriors of Water Dragon - are marching to the Alligator Beach. Be extra careful if you go there.<br>
Where would you like to go?<br>
