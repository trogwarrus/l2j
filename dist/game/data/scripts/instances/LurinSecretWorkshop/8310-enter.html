Hesed told me you'd come.<br>
I've found the golem, but it seems that Lurin has already sniffed out the secret of our new technology.<br>
I'll lend you my golem so that you could stop Lurin and his minions.<br>
If you destroy Lurin's golem, you'll get some <font color="LEVEL">points</font>.<br>
Keep in mind that you can set macros for your golem's skills.<br>
