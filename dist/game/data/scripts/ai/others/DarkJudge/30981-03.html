<html><body>Dark Judge:<br>
Many sinners think they can wash their sins away easily. We, Dark Judges, don't think so, and don't allow to be so.
That's why we've changed redemption requirements.<br>
Now only characters of <FONT color="LEVEL">Lv. 85 and higher</FONT> who paid <FONT color="LEVEL">10,000,000 adena </FONT> and got <FONT color="LEVEL">Scroll: Summon Sin Eater</FONT> can receive absolution. Those who have the scroll can accept a special quest. Complete it - and we'll forgive a part of your sins as a reward.<br>
Keep in mind that you can buy a Scroll: Summon Sin Eater and complete the quest only once a day.<br>
