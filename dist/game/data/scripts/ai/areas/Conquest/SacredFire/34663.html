						* The Sacred Fire Summon Scroll can be exchanged at the Conquest Shop in the Conquest UI, and you can light 3 Sacred Fires at once. You can check the status of your Sacred Fire by clicking the Sacred Fire UI in the Conquest stats enchancement UI.<br><br>
						* If you succeed in stealing the Sacred Fire summoned by another server member, you have a chance to obtain the Divine Fire. Each attempt to steal costs a certain amount, and if you fail, you get nothing.<br><br>
						* Compensation is automatically given when the Sacred Fire is extinguished due to success/failure, but if the inventory quantity and weight are over 90%, the reward will not be given and the Sacred fire will be extinguished.</font><br><br>
