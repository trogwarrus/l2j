<html><body>Beast Herder Tunatun:<br>
As you can see, the area surrounding the Beast Farm has changed. in order to protect the beasts from the enemies I took a good care of them and feed them well. Maybe even too well, they've become violent. So we've sent the youngest and the friendliest beasts to the safe place in the north.<br>
They still can be breed, they just need food. But the way to the north may be dangerous for the travelers. I can teleport you there if you want.<br>
