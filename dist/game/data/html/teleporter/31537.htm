<html><body>Beast Herder Tunatun:<br>
Welcome to the Beast Farm! My name is Tunatun and I'm in charge here. I started working here in order to better understand the beasts, but I got a little carried away, he-he.<br>
Although, I'm the manager, it doesn't mean I can make them obey me. I only make deals with Feed Sellers and hire adventurers.<br>
But I've heard the news about the <font color="LEVEL">changes at the Clan Hall Siege area</font>.<br>
