This icy air is perfect for pounding the steel! Scorching fire and icy air -- that's what makes good, hard steel! Conflict makes everything stronger, that's for sure!<br>
Same with life -- no matter how much sorrow or turmoil you may face, if you can endure it, you will become as strong and resilient as tempered steel!<br>
