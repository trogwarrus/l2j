<html><body>Springs' Dwarf Kinbad<br>
My name is Kinbad. I'm one of the Spring's Dwarves that have taken over this area<br>
You are lucky. I'm going to have some rest in the Springs. So I'm calm and not looking for a fight.<br>
But who knows what will happen when we meet next time. Ha-ha! I wonder how the things will turn out then.
