Hello! I take it, you've already been to the Conquest world. I bet it impressed you as much as your world impressed me once. But I haven't come here for sightseeing.<br>
By the way, you aren't the <font color="LEVEL">Conquest Leader</font>, aren't you? If you are, then I have a special reward for you, keep that in mind. The Conquest Leader reward can also be received via a <font color="LEVEL">special UI</font>.<br>
Not the Conquest Leader after all? Don't feel bad. I can always sell you some useful things for Bloody Coins. What do you say?<br>
