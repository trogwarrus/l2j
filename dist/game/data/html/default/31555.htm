<html><body>Mercenary Supplier Abercrombie:<br>
Greetings! I am in charge of the supplies, and, as you might imagine, managing shipments in the swamps is quite a tall order. It is made especially difficult by the local monsters.<br>
Have you heard of <font color="LEVEL">Petra</font> yet? It's the strongest of the local monsters. We call it <font color="ff6868">the Stakato Queen</font>.<br>
Wherever it goes, chaos ensues. But I've heard its her heart has special properties. We could really use it...<br>
So, if you come across the <font color="ff6868">Stakato Queen's Heart</font>, make sure to bring it to me. I'll reward you handsomely, you have my word.<br>
