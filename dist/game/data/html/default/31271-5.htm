Do you want to ask something? I can augment an item or remove augmentation.<br>
Do you know that Life Stones can't be obtained any more? Fortunately, more powerful stones have been discovered, they're called <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Augmenting Stones</font>. The stones were created from Life Stones affected by dimensional energy, so don't worry.<br>
