<html><body>Fire Fortress Guide Kellond:<br>
Greetings! I hope we'll become friends, and friends have no use for formalities. There is no need to call me Fire Fortress Guide.<br>
Friends call me <font color="LEVEL">Kellond the Immortal</font>!<br>
Care to know why? That's quite simple.<br>
I'm called the Immortal because, unlike you, I never put myself at risk and try to avoid difficulties that threaten my life. What is even more important, I always keep to safe places!<br>
To my mind, this is the safest place in all the Conquest world, which means I'll never ever leave it!<br>
