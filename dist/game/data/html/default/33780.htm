<html><body>Hesed of the Black Anvil Guild:<br>
Recently peerless masters of our Black Anvil Guild have devised a brand new technology.<br>
We have managed to create a unique golem with it. Unfortunately, it has been stolen by Lurin. This scoundrel wants to learn the secret of our technology and use it for his own benefit<br>
You must stop Lurin and return our golem.<br>
