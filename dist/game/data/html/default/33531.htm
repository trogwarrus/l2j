Hello.<br1>
I am Zeshen, the Aden Kingdom's Trade Manager. Do you want to learn more about what I do?<br>
To put it a nutshell, here you can purchase items put on sale by others!<br1>
Of course, you can also sell your items, if you want.<br>
If you pay the fee when registering item for sale, you can save a great deal!<br1>
One more advantage is that <font color="LEVEL">sales commission will be collected automatically after you deal is complete</font>,<br1>
Well, do you want to try?<br>
