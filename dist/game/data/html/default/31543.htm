The Hot Springs have become a really hot topic recently among the Dwarves! Even though it's so hot here. And I was curious too! Why is this place so popular? What's so special about it?<br>
I put a lot of effort and finally figured out the true effect of the Hot Springs! And now I'm here to try it myself.<br>
Aren't you interested at all? Even a little bit? The Hot Springs true effect is... Don't be surprised. They can boost your <font color="LEVL">hair growth</font>! Soon I'm going to look like me in the best years!<br>
So? And what have you heard about the Hot Springs?<br>
