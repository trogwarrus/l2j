It's simple. You need to defeat Freya in the Ice Queen's Castle.<br>
You can enter the Ice Queen's Castle in a <font color="LEVEL">party of 2-7 players of Lv. 115 or higher</font>. You won't need to choose difficulty level here: Unlike daily instance zones, here there is only one difficulty.<br>
If you defeat Freya, you will be able to re-enter the Ice Queen's Castle only after resetting <font color="LEVEL">each Wednesday at 06:30</font>.<br>
Note that during the battle you can re-enter the zone, but <font color="LEVEL">if all the members of your party left</font>, you need to return there <font color="LEVEL">within 1 minute</font>.<br>
