<html><body>Seed Talisman Manager:<br>
Since Gracia and Aden have made an alliance, the research of Gracia's Seed is progressing at a quick rate. For instance, we've found talismans in several seeds.<br>
Those are Talisman of Infinity, Talisman of Destruction, Talisman of Annihilation, Talisman of Hellfire, Talisman of Desire, Talisman of Longing, and Talisman of Insanity and Heavenly Talisman. However, I can give you only the Talisman of Infinity.<br>
Don't worry! Using <font color="LEVEL">Energy of Destruction</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Energy</font>, you can create a Seed Talisman that's more powerful than Talisman of Destruction - if you're lucky, of course. You can equip several Seed Talismans, but only the most powerful of them will be active.<br>
You can <font color="LEVEL">seal Talisman of Longing</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Talisman of Insanity</font> to <font color="LEVEL">give them</font> to <font color="LEVEL">another character</font>.<br>
If you use several talismans, <font color="LEVEL">only one will be active</font>.<br>
By the way, you can try crafting Talisman of Insanity and Heavenly Talisman by yourself via the <font color="LEVEL">compounding</font> option in your inventory. But I'd recommend using my services to increase your success rate, because these are very rare items and it's not that easy to get them.<br1>
