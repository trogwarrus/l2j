This place is where you can address Sayha directly, and<br1>
the God will listen<br>
In the Wind Spirit Realm I always asked for Sayha's<br1>
advice in something went wrong in Faeron.<br>
I'm glad that this obelisk has survived the transfer to the<br1>
Material Realm. However, I don't hear Sayha's voice<br1>
anymore, and it troubles me to no end. but I do believe<br1>
that the God would never leave his children.<br>
