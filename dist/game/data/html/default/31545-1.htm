Oh, what are you talking about? I hate battles. Not all the Dwarves fond of fighting.<br>
I don't know, maybe, it's because I like the Hot Springs... Yeah, I think that's the reason.<br>
If you are tired or exausted, dive into the water! The Springs will bring you true delight. Isn't it a perfect way to end the day?<br>
