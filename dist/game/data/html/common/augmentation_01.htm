<font color="LEVEL">Augmentation</font> imbues weapons and accessories with special powers.<br>
Augmentation is a rather simple process if you know what you're doing. If you bring me a <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stone</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Augmenting Stone</font> as well as a few other necessities, I'll be able to augment your armor and weapons.<br>
You should know one thing though, A Spirit Stone is forever bound to its owner, if you use it to augment a weapon, you won't be able to sell or exchange it. I should also add that if the grade of the stone is higher than the skill level of the owner, the augmentation will have no effect.
Finally, you will need very expensive items to augment an item. So, would you like to begin?<br>
