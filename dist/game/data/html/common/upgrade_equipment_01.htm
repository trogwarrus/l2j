Have you heard of the crystals Spirit Crystals? People find those quite often in Aden lately. As some elders and blacksmiths say, these crystals can be used for equipment upgrade.<br>
One of the elders taught me to use this power. So I can help you upgrade your items!<br>
Crystals for upgrading are different. <font color="LEVEL">Crystal of Determination</font> is required for weapon upgrading, <font color="LEVEL">Crystal of Protection</font> is required for armor upgrading. Also you will need <font color="LEVEL">blessed weapon or armor</font> that is able to hold the crystal's energy. Besides you will need circlets, Dragon Skin Shirt, Kaliel's Bracelet, La Vie En Rose's Brooch and Artifact Books. Items for upgrading must also be <font color="LEVEL">enchanted</font>, otherwise it won't absorb the crystal's power. So, do you want me to upgrade something?<br>
