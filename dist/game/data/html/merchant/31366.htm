<html><body>Feed Seller:<br>
Welcome to the Beast Farm! Here we breed ferocious beasts! Whether the beasts will obey or attack you depends of your luck<br>
I sell feed for the beasts. There are two types of it: <font color="LEVEL">Golden Spice</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Crystal Spice</font>.Golden Spice makes beasts sturdier, and Crystal one makes them stronger. Buy and try to use both types of the feed, you'll figure out what to do.<br>
The beasts you see here have already fully grown. It's useless to feed them, you'll see no effect whatsoever. Why don't you try talking to Beast Herder Tunatun? He manages the Farm and knows more about it than I do.<br>
