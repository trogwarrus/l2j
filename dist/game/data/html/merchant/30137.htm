Give me a minute, please. I just can't calm down... It all feels like a nightmare I can't wake up from. Thank heavens I was able to grab some items before leaving the village. Otherwise I'd be in so much trouble. Wanna see my wares? I'm sure you'll find something useful. It's a win-win for both of us!<br>
