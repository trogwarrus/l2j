Do you have a <font color="LEVEL">Guard Agathion Fragment</font>? Then you've come to the right place. I use those fragments to create <font color="LEVEL">Agathion Charms containing the power of Masia's, Paulina's or Tersi's Guard</font>.<br>
Also, I can exchange the fragments for an <font color="LEVEL">Agathion Guard Book of Growth</font>.<br>
I would also need an <font color="LEVEL">Angel's Breath</font> for the exchange, so bring it to me first. Or buy it from me, heh heh.<br>
